h1. Algorithms

Implementation of popular sort and search algorithms in Ruby. Yay!

h2. Big-Oh Notation

* Used for analysing the complexity of algorithms.
* Useful when dealing with large data sets.
* Estimates execution time and memory used.

h3. Cheat-sheets

| O(1) | Constant | Lookup table, hash table. |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search on sorted array, balan^ced tree search. |
| O(n) | Linear | Sequential search on unsorted list, search on malformed tree. |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Quicksort, heapsort, mergesort. |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic | Buble sort, shell sort, quick sort (worst case), selection sort, insertion sort. |
| O(n^c), c > 1 | Polynomial | Bipartite graphs. |
| O(c^N), c > 1 | Exponential | Brute-force search. |
| O(n!) | Factorial | Brute-force search. |

| O(1) | The input data set doesn't matter. |
| O(log n) | Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on the growth. |
| O(n) | Performan^ce is directly proportional to input data set. |
| O(n^2) | Performan^ce is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. |
| O(2^n) | Growth will double with each additional element in the input data set. |

|_. Algorithm |_. Best |_. Worst |_. Average |_. Comment |
| Bubble sort | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | Only good with ideal data. |
| Selection sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | Best O(n^2) sort. |
| Quick sort | O(n log n) | O(n^2) | O(n log n) | Good, but not with O(n^2). |
| Heap sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | Slower than QS, but worst case is much better. |
